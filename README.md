## How do you use this repository - Devlopment environment setup
Within the `.devcontainer` folder, you'll find a file that describes a C++ development environment. By utilizing this file in Visual Studio Code, you can establish a connection to a Linux-based development environment. The steps involved are as follows:
- Make sure you have **Docker Desktop** installed and running on your computer
- Install the **Remote Development** extension pack in Visual Studio Code
Once the installations are complete, follow these steps:
- Open the Command Palette (usually by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for `Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume`
- You may need to authorize the extension for GitHub authentication. You will be redirected to your web browser to complete this process
- A development container will be created and started in the background. You may see a terminal window open while the container is being created
